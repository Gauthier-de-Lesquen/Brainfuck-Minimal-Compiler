# Brainfuck-Minimal-Compiler
*This is a minimal BrainFuck to C and then to executable compiler. Depedency : GCC*

## How To Use It ?
To use it, you must do like when you use gcc. After compiling the C file (or downloading the .exe attached) and added it to path, you can use it like that :
```bf code.bf```
> that will compile with the name code.exe
Else, you can compile like:
```bf code.bf -o program.exe```
> that will produce a program.exe file
